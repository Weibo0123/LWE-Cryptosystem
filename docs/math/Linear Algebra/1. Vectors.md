## Vectors

## **1. Geometric Intuition (2D)**

A vector can be visualized as an **arrow in the plane**.

Place the tail at the origin.

A coordinate pair:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
$$

specifies how to reach the tip.

Interpretation:

- move $x$ units along the $x$-axis
- then move $y$ units parallel to the $y$-axis

Sign convention:

- positive → right / up  
- negative → left / down  

Properties:

- each coordinate pair corresponds to exactly one vector  
- each vector corresponds to exactly one coordinate pair  

Thus, coordinates represent **movement instructions**.

## **2. Geometric Intuition (3D)**

In three dimensions, introduce a third axis $z$.

Vectors are written as:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Interpretation:

- move along $x$
- then along $y$
- then along $z$

Each ordered triplet corresponds to one unique vector in space.

## **3. Fundamental Vector Operations**

Linear algebra is defined by **operations on vectors**, not by arrows.

Two operations are fundamental.

### **Addition**

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
y_1
\end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix}
x_2 \\
y_2
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 + x_2 \\
y_1 + y_2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- performed component-wise  
- geometrically: place arrows head-to-tail

### **Scalar Multiplication**

$$
c
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
cx \\
cy
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- multiply each coordinate by $c$

Geometric effects:

- $|c| > 1$ → stretch  
- $0 < |c| < 1$ → shrink  
- $c < 0$ → reverse direction

## **4. Vector vs Point**

A vector is **not** a point.

- point → location  
- vector → displacement or movement  

Vectors describe **change**, not position.

---

## **5. Abstract Definition of a Vector**

The geometric arrow interpretation is only a visualization.

### **Definition**

A vector is any object for which:

- vector addition is defined  
- scalar multiplication is defined  
- these operations satisfy algebraic rules  

---

### **Typical Algebraic Rules**

Examples:

- commutativity: $u + v = v + u$
- associativity
- existence of a zero vector
- existence of additive inverses
- distributive laws

A set satisfying these rules is called a **vector space**.
